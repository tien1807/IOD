    "**Note**: This notebook should work on your local machine.\n",

    "The purpose of this lab is to take you through the process of deploying a machine learning web app on a publicly hosted platform (streamlit.io and optionally render.com). A trained model will be created using the Scikit-learn pipeline (combining loading, preprocessing and training steps), then separate files of Python code and text will need to be completed to make deployment possible. Firstly the app will be deployed to your local machine (so that you can view it in your browser). Once that it is successful, the files will be uploaded to a new repository you create in GitHub and then Streamlit or Render will read from this to host the application via a publicly accessible URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app will take in a text string from a user and output a prediction of whether that string is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The model is created using methods from Module 8 (Natural Language Processing). Since the training data used to create the model is small (300 records), the prediction may only be accurate around 70% of the time. In future you may wish to improve this app's performance or develop your own app in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following files are needed to create the app (they should be in the same folder as this notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    "- requirements.txt\n",
    "- app.py\n",
    "- model.joblib\n",
    "- utils.py\n",
    "- .streamlit/ (folder containing config.toml)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we will see how a predictive model can be created as a pipe which combines the preprocessing, feature engineering and model training steps. This model is then saved as a joblib pickle file which can be reloaded at any time to avoid retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trained model can be loaded within your production environment along with required packages and real-time predictions can be made by calling its predict() method."
